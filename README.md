# get-last-5-commits
get the last five commits as markdown of a local filesytem git repo

the primary usage is to be able to give a markdown lsit to github
that can be used in various places (from circle ci to a slack notification as an example etc)

# install

```
cp .env.example .env.development
yarn
yarn start:dev

edit environment to point to the git repo,
and where the repo is on github,
it will link to commits that are already on github
```

# known issues

if you wish to pipe this content anywhere, plese just call `node index.js`
as yarn and npm scripts have the annoying "âœ¨  Done in 0.27s."
which ruins the output, you may need to run the full command from `yarn:start:dev`
this is the first time i have came across this problem..
